# IE343_HW
I started with while since I know that when we opened 5 facilities we are done with opening facility.
Then,I tried to find the shortest way with enumerate all possibilities.I did this with distfrom method.
After that,Ä± tried to find the minimum of the distances with using .sort method for arraylists and tried to remove this facility in the array_fac arraylist.
Then I did,almost same procedure in else then I finished the algortihm.
For the question in manual,execution time increases when I increased the size of problem.I guess,if I increased a lot like 10000 facilities,20000 customers,I can see this increase in execution time easily.
